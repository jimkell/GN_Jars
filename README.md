# GN_Jars
For Windows users, just click on the .bat file to run. If Windows give an error message, open the .bat file in a text editor like Notepad++ or Sublime text editor (not Notepad) and save the file. (You may have to edit the file - hit space bar, then backspace, to enable Save in Notepad++). For Mac copy the command in the .bat file and run it in the directory containing vn_052722.jar.

To add another project, copy the tumor and normal folders into this directory and modify the command in the .bat file to:
java -jar vn_052722.jar <tumor_folder_name>.
